# LUT Histogram Min Max Adjustment

## Introduction

Change LUT's Min and Max values using GUI. For SDR (or even HDR) displays, it can help in reducing some overblown white/bloom (i.e., neon signs) areas by decreasing Max range and crushed blacks in certain areas by decreasing Min range (just be careful to not lose the texture details when adjusting the values). You can also experiment with some combinations to make Instagram-like filters (i.e., make your own LUT).

It can be used in combination with Gamma Controls to get the best picture out of your display for whatever LUT you are using in your game.
